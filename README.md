# Lens ring for Jielde Lights

The fresnel lens is best known for lighttowers.
However, in the 1950s and 1960s the lens was also introduced for the Jielde lamp.
It kept the dirt out of the shade and prevented to look directly into the classic light bulb during the long ours in the workshops.

The diameter of the hood varies between 159 mm and 161 mm.
The thickness of the folded edge of the hood varies between 4,5 and 4,8mm.

## Design

This design contains one parametric openSCAD design and two pre-rendered STL files. 
One of them has a design with a diameter of 159.5 and the other 160 mm.
The overall thickness of the ring is 1.2 mm.
The height of the ring is 10 mm to give it a clearly visible edge.

The ring design has an inner diameter of 162 mm at the lens.
It gives the lens sufficient clearance.
A diameter of 160 or 161 mm is too tight and leaves no room for clearance.
It is not uncommon that the Jielde caps are deformed and no longer round.

We fell in love with the yellow color. 
The lamp may simply be seen and black is so 50s...
